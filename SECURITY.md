# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The supported security scope for `weatherbot` is the current default branch, `master`. Older commits, tags, branches, forks, demos, and generated artifacts are not actively supported unless the repository explicitly marks them as maintained.

Project summary: A chat bot for the weather

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting or by opening a draft GitHub Security Advisory for `garethpaul/weatherbot` when that option is available. If GitHub does not show a private reporting option for this repository, contact the repository owner through GitHub and avoid posting exploit details publicly until the issue can be assessed.

Do not open a public issue that includes exploit code, secrets, personal data, or detailed reproduction steps for an unpatched vulnerability.

## What to Include

Helpful reports include:

- the affected file, endpoint, permission, dependency, or workflow
- a concise impact statement explaining what an attacker could do
- reproduction steps using test data and accounts you control
- the branch, commit SHA, platform version, device, runtime, or dependency versions used
- logs, screenshots, or proof-of-concept snippets that demonstrate impact without exposing private data

## Project Security Posture

- This repository appears to be a Python web API or service project. The active security scope is the code and documentation on the default branch.
- Review found authentication, token, or session-related code paths; changes in those areas should receive security-focused review before merge.
- Review found external API integrations or credential-adjacent configuration; changes in those areas should receive security-focused review before merge.
- Review found network clients, sockets, web APIs, or service endpoints; changes in those areas should receive security-focused review before merge.
- Review found mobile permission or privacy-sensitive data handling; changes in those areas should receive security-focused review before merge.
- Review found file, document, data, or media parsing flows; changes in those areas should receive security-focused review before merge.
- Review found infrastructure, deployment, proxy, or cloud configuration; changes in those areas should receive security-focused review before merge.
- Dependency manifests detected: requirements.txt. Dependency updates should preserve lockfiles when present and avoid introducing packages without a clear maintenance reason.

## Service and API Notes

Messenger POST webhooks require a valid `X-Hub-Signature-256` calculated with
`FB_APP_SECRET`. Keep that secret distinct from page and verification tokens.
Webhook bodies larger than 1 MiB are rejected with HTTP 413 before signature
verification, JSON parsing, or Wit action dispatch.
Messenger POST requests must use the `application/json` media type; optional
parameters and case differences are accepted, while other types return 415
before signature verification or JSON parsing.
Messenger GET verification challenges are returned as UTF-8 plain text so
untrusted challenge values cannot be interpreted as HTML.
Recent non-empty Messenger message IDs are claimed before Wit actions in a
bounded process-local cache. Duplicate deliveries are acknowledged without
repeating actions, while failed actions release their claims for provider
retries. Claims do not span workers or process restarts.
Messenger provider HTTP errors propagate through the Wit action and release
the current message-ID claim so a later webhook delivery can retry the reply.
OpenWeather failures for a known location produce a stable user-facing
retry-later message. Provider exception text and stale Wit forecast copy are
not forwarded to the Messenger user.
Each signed webhook processes at most 20 valid Messenger user messages in
payload order. Malformed nested sender or message values are ignored without
preventing later valid events from reaching Wit.

For web services, APIs, sockets, or scraping workflows, prioritize reports involving authentication bypass, authorization errors, injection, server-side request forgery, unsafe deserialization, credential leakage, data exposure, or denial-of-service conditions. Use test accounts and minimal proof-of-concept traffic only.

Messenger webhook payloads should only invoke Wit actions when both the sender
ID and message text are textual and nonblank. Malformed sender IDs should be
acknowledged without creating a Wit session.

Expected Wit transport and response failures are isolated to the affected
event so they do not force retries of an authenticated Messenger batch after
earlier replies may have been sent. Public errors and logs must not include
tokens, sender IDs, message text, request URLs, or provider response bodies.

## Dependency and Supply Chain Security

Dependency updates should come from trusted package managers and should keep lockfiles in sync when lockfiles exist. Do not commit credentials, private keys, tokens, generated secrets, or machine-local configuration. If a vulnerability depends on a compromised package, typosquatting risk, insecure transitive dependency, or unsafe build step, include the package name, affected version, and the path through which it is used.

## Safe Research Guidelines

Good-faith research is welcome when it stays within these boundaries:

- use only accounts, devices, data, and infrastructure that you own or have explicit permission to test
- avoid destructive actions, persistence, spam, phishing, social engineering, or denial-of-service testing
- minimize access to personal data and stop testing immediately if private data is exposed
- do not exfiltrate secrets or third-party data; report the minimum evidence needed to verify impact
- keep vulnerability details confidential until the maintainer has assessed the report

## Maintainer Response

The maintainer will review complete reports as availability allows, prioritize issues by exploitability and impact, and coordinate a fix or mitigation when the affected code is still maintained. For sample, archived, or educational repositories, the likely remediation may be documentation, dependency updates, or clearly marking unsupported code rather than a production-style patch release.
